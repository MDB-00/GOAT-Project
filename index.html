    <h3>Who is Connor Kenway?</h3>
    <p class="text">
      Connor is the third playable assassin in the Assassin's Creed video game
      series. He was a Master Assassin of the Colonial Brotherhood during the
      period of the American Revolutionary War. Being half British and half
      Mohawk, Connor had a difficult time of fitting into American culture.
      After spending years fighting off the Templars, the Assassin's mortal
      enemy, and rebuilding the Colonial Brotherhood, Connor became a central
      figure in the American Revolution as he helped the Patriot cause with the
      goal of protecting his people's lands from incursions and preventing the
      Templars from taking control of the young United States.
